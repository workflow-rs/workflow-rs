//!
//! [`workflow_core`] is a part of the [`workflow-rs`](https://crates.io/workflow-rs)
//! framework, subset of which is designed to function uniformly across multiple
//! environments including native Rust, WASM-browser and Solana OS targets.
//!
//! This is a general-purpose crate that provides platform-uniform (native and WASM) abstractions for:
//! - async channels
//! - task spawn, sleep and interval functions
//! - random identifiers
//! - async-friendly and thread-safe event triggers
//! - time (Instant and Duration) as well as functions to obtain UNIX time (native and WASM)
//! - yield_executor() function to yield Rust executor to browser using `requestAnimationFrame()` (this prevents async Rust applications from locking down the Browser UX)
//! - runtime auto detection, allowing to identify the operating environment at runtime
//! - home and data folder access (useful when combined with `workflow_store` crate)
